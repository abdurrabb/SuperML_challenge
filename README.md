# preview test data


# separate target from predictive features


# convert categorical data to numeric


# separate target feature for training data


# encode the target column with 1s and 0s (both train and test)


# check the shapes to make sure X_train and X_test have the same number of columns (same with y_train/y_test)
# check that X_train and y_train have the same number of rows (same with X_test/y_test)


# train the Logistic Regression model on the unscaled data
# print the model train and test score


# Random Forest Classifier training model and test score
# print the model train and test score


# create a scaler based on the X_train data
# use the scaler on X_train and X_test


# Logistic Regression training model on scaled data; train/test score
# print the model train and test score


# random Forest Classifier training model on the scaled data
# print the model train and test score


# fit a model, and then print a classification report
# print the model train and test score


# fit Extremely Random Trees classifier
# print the model train and test score
solid performance, not overfit

# let see what this one does
# print the model train and test score
not sure what this one does

# transform scaled data
favored preprocessor, using .95 to explain 95% of the variance in data

# get four pcs for the  data
given the large number of columns (91) in the original dummied data set,

# apply Logistic Regression to the Transformed Data
# print the model train and test score
